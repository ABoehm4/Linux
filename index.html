<div id ="history"><h2 class="clear">Our History</h2>
<p>Broadsword Marketing and Promotions had very humble beginnings. Our President, Founder, and CEO Tom Hanks, was very passionate in his High School days about marketing. He would approach individuals 
running for Student Council and offer his services to market their campaign. His name started to become known in his young age for doing fine work regarding public relations, social media marketing
web design, and event management. Tom was always a go-getter. He received a scholarship to Harvard for Marketing Communications and graduted sumama cum laude. From there, Tom created a small company called Broadsword 
Marketing and Promotions in order to follow his dream. He hired some of his acquaintances from Harvard and set a goal of becoming a large, well known corporation. They fought hard for marketing contracts from smaller 
companies. The work started to become recognized by a few larger companies such as Amazon and Google. They decided to hire Broadsword for some smaller projects they had in mind. Tom and his associates knocked the test 
out of the park and were hired by Amazon and Google to design their main websites.</p>
