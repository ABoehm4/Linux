	<h1>Apache Security Tips</h1>
	<h2>By: Adam Boehm</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>This website will list three items that I feel are important regarding security for Apache in linux. The items will be chosen from 
	<a href="http://www.tecmint.com/apache-security-tips/" target="_blank">Temint</a> and <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/misc/security_tips.html" target="_blank">Apache.org</a>.<br>
	These two websites list a multitude of security tips for Apache servers, and how to implement them. </p>
<p>The three items I have chosen are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How to hide Apache Version and OS Identity from Errors</li>
		<li>Keep updating Apache regularly</li>
		<li>Use Allow and Deny to Restrict access to Directories</li>
	</ul>


<h4>How to hide Apache Version and OS Identity from Errors</h4>

<p>When Apache is installed on your server, it will display the Apache version that is installed on your operating system. You can test this by typing in http://"Your server address"/test, with what your server IP address is in quotes.</p>
<p align="center">When you type in the previous html command, the following page will show up (with your IP information).</p>
<img src="http://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Show-Apache-Version-620x396.png" alt="apache_version">
<p align="center">As you can see, the Apache version and your server address are displayed for all to see.</p>
<p>In order to hide that information, we are going to make some changes to the Apache main config file.<br>
	Open the main config file with your preferred text editor: <strong>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</strong> (RHEL/CenOS/Fedora) and <strong>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</strong> (Debian/Ubuntu)</p>
	<div>nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf<br>
		nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf</div>
	<p>Search for "ServerSignature", it should be set to <strong>On</strong> by default. We are now going to turn that setting <strong>Off</strong>. <br>
	You also need to add the line <strong>ServerTokens Prod</strong> if it's not already there. This will tell Apache to return only Apache as its product and not return the operating system or server address.<br></p>
	<div>ServerSignature Off<br>
		ServerTokens Prod</div>
	<p>Once you changed the first line to <strong>Off</strong>, and added the second line, save and exit the main config file. <br>
	Now type in <strong>server http restart</strong> (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) <strong>service apache2 restart</strong> (Debian/Ubuntu). You can now retest your webpage and the information should not be displayed.</p>
<p>This website <a href="http://www.ducea.com/2006/06/15/apache-tips-tricks-hide-apache-software-version/" target="_blank">Ducea.com</a> goes into depth more regarding hiding Apache versions.</p>


<h4>Keep updating Apache regularly</h4>

<p>Apache developers are constantly working on fixing security issues and other general fixes for Apache. They consistently release new versions of Apache with new security options. It is recommended that we keep Apache updated with its newest version.<br>
	To check your <strong>Apache</strong> version, type in <strong>httpd -v</strong> command. It should come back with your <strong>Server version</strong> and your <strong>Server built</strong> date.<br></p>
	<div>httpd -v <br><br>
		Server version: Apache/2.2.15 (Unix)<br>
		Server built:   Aug 13 2013 17:29:28</div>
	<p>You can update your Apache server by entering the command <strong>yum update http</strong>. You should also ensure you are keeping your Kernel and OS update with the most recent stable builds.</p>


<h4>Use Allow and Deny to Restrict access to Directories</h4>

<p>You can restrict access to directories with <strong>Allow</strong> and <strong>Deny</strong> options in the main configuration file <strong>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</strong>. For this example, we'll secure our root directory. <br>
	Open your main configuration file and search for <strong>Directory /</strong></p>
	<div><p>&lt;/Directory /><br>
	Options None<br>
	Order deny,allow<br>
	Deny from all<br>
	&lt;/Directory></div>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Options "None"</strong> - This will not allow other users to enable any optional features.</li>
		<li><strong>Order deny, allow</strong> - This is the order in which the directives of Deny and Allow are processed. For this example, it is Deny first, allow second.</li>
		<li><strong>Deny from all</strong> - This denies all requests from everybody to the root directory.</li>
	</ul>
